# Stock Market Simulator

This is a simple stock market simulator that allows users to simulate buying and selling stocks based on historical data. The simulator uses data from the Yahoo Finance but from a custom api to fetch historical stock prices and display them in a table. Users can select a stock symbol, a date range, and a buy/sell time (open, high, low, or close) to simulate buying and selling stocks. The simulator then calculates the profit/loss based on the selected options.
